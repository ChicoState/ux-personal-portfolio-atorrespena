# UX Portfolio

I am from Southern California, im currently majoring in Computer Science because exploring the world of algorithms fascinates me. I have some hands-on experience particularly in addressing minor repairs for cars and learning more about the world of technology fascinates me since its consistently growing and changing. Additionally, I like go to the gym to unwind and take my mind off things.
